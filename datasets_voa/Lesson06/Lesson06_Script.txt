Anna: Hi there! I’m Anna and I live in Washington, D.C. Every day I learn more about this great city. People in Washington like to work out! Oh, hi, Pete. How’s it going?
Pete: Hi, Anna. It’s going great. How’s it going with you?
Anna: Things are awesome! Pete, I want to work out. Where is the gym?
Pete: The gym is across from the lounge. It’s next to the mailroom. Go that way.
Anna: Thanks, Pete!
(Anna walks away)
Pete: No, Anna! Not that way! Go that way!

Anna: Oh, Pete. This is not the gym.
